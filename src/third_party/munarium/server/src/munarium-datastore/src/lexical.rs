//! The Tantivy lexical adapter.
//!
//! Uses Tantivy through its **public crate API** only — no `columnar`, no
//! `sstable`, no private internals (§6.1). A fork is a later, evidence-based
//! decision; this is the seam that makes one unnecessary for now.
//!
//! ## Why the query is a plan, not a string
//!
//! `LexicalPlan` arrives already expanded, normalized and demoted. No backend
//! re-derives any of that from a string, so PostgreSQL and Tantivy answer the
//! *same* question and a difference between them is attributable to the engine
//! — which is the only thing shadow mode can measure. The plan type is defined
//! HERE rather than imported, because this crate must not depend on
//! `munarium-core`; the coordinator translates between the two.
//!
//! ## Positions, from day one
//!
//! The schema indexes with positions even though nothing here needs them yet.
//! The current phrase and substring demotions read positions, and an artifact
//! built without them could not serve those rules without a rebuild — a
//! decision that would be discovered at cutover rather than at build.
//!
//! ## v1 storage: one archived component
//!
//! Tantivy writes many files. They are archived into a single `lexical/` blob
//! so the manifest lists one component with one hash, and open materializes
//! them into a scratch directory. That trades memory for simplicity, which is
//! the right trade while whole-artifact hydration is the serving path anyway;
//! the `Directory`-backed range-read path is explicitly a stage 10 experiment.
