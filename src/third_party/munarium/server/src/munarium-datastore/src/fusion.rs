//! Engine-neutral fusion and deterministic shaping.

//! Fusion here consumes **ranks**, never raw leg scores. That is not a stylistic
//! preference: PostgreSQL `ts_rank` and Tantivy BM25 are not numerically
//! comparable, and neither is a BM25 score against a cosine distance. A merge
//! that adds them produces plausible results in the wrong order — the failure
//! is silent, which is what makes it dangerous.
//!
//! The existing PostgreSQL path fuses from raw leg scores on purpose (it is
//! sound while one engine produces every score, and a 2026-08-24 regression
//! test pins the reason). This module is what has to replace that call site
//! before any multi-search can mix engines — see

//! Every policy is named and versioned so a recorded result can be explained.
