//! implementation that first proved it. The model proposes; the mesh disposes.

//! Semantic invariants carried over verbatim (the conformance suite enforces
//! them against every storage backend):
//!
//! - The ledger is append-only. A correction is a NEW claim naming
//!   `supersedes_id`; nothing is ever updated in place.
//! - `seq` is monotonic across a version lineage (one counting domain), and
//!   every store stamps from it, so ONE `as_of_seq` pin bounds facts, anchors,
//!   promises, counters, and entities together.
//! - `slice_facts` resolves supersession AS OF the pin: the superseded-set is
//!   itself filtered by `seq <= as_of_seq`, so a claim superseded later still
//!   reads as current at the pin.
//! - Gate-blocked claims are recorded `disputed`, never dropped.
//! - Digests are deterministically REBUILT under a pin, never served stored.

// Production code returns typed errors instead of panicking; tests are exempt.
// The policy, its two exemptions and the per-site record are in
// server/docs/panic-boundaries.md (P15/R32).
